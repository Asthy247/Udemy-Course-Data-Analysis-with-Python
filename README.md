# Udemy-Course-Data-Analysis-with-Python

# Introduction
This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of the Udemy Courses dataset (Kaggle dataset), 
aiming to uncover insights into course offerings, pricing strategies, and subscriber engagement. 
By leveraging Python and data analysis libraries like Pandas, we explore the 
relationship between various factors, such as course duration, price, subject, and subscriber numbers.

# Data Exploration and Cleaning

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises a diverse range of courses across subjects like Business Finance,
Web Development, Musical Instruments, and Graphic Design. 
Initial data exploration revealed the need for data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.

# Key Findings and Insights

**1. Course Duration and Subscriber Engagement:**

•	We found a weak correlation between course duration and the number of subscribers. 
This suggests that factors like course quality, instructor expertise, and effective marketing strategies play a crucial role in attracting learners.

•	Paid courses, particularly those with higher production values and experienced instructors, tend to attract more subscribers, regardless of duration.

**2. Subject-wise Course Distribution:**

•	Web Development and Business Finance are the most popular subjects on the platform, accounting for a significant portion of the courses.

•	Musical Instruments and Graphic Design have a smaller but dedicated following.

****3. Pricing Strategies:**

**Interpretation of Scatter Plot:**

•	This visualization helps us understand the relationship between the duration of a course and the number of subscribers.

•	We can identify if longer courses tend to attract more subscribers, or if shorter, more concise courses are more popular.

•	The hue parameter allows us to differentiate between paid and free courses, providing additional insights.

**Key Observations:**

**No Strong Correlation:** 
There doesn't seem to be a strong linear correlation between course duration and the number of subscribers. 
This suggests that longer courses aren't necessarily more popular.	

**Wide Range of Subscriber Numbers:** 
For a given course duration, there's a wide range of subscriber numbers. This indicates that other factors, 
such as course quality, instructor popularity, and marketing efforts, play a significant role in determining subscriber numbers.

**Impact of Paid Courses:** The scatter plot doesn't explicitly differentiate between paid and free courses. 
However, it's likely that paid courses, especially those with higher production values and expert instructors, 
tend to attract more subscribers, regardless of duration.

**We can observe the following:**

**1.	Dominant Subjects:**

o	Web Development and Business Finance are the most popular subjects on the platform, 

with a significantly higher number of courses compared to the other two categories.

o	Musical Instruments and Graphic Design have a considerably smaller number of courses.

**2.	Potential Reasons for Dominance:**

o	Market Demand: Web Development and Business Finance are high-demand skills in today's job market, leading to a surge in online courses.

o	Technological Advancements: The rapid evolution of web development and business technologies might contribute to the high number of courses in these areas.
